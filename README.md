I coded that using Bootstrap when I was at 3rd course of university. I needed to get a credit for discipline and I had 2 days. My task was to create the pedagogical piggy bank wich would be useful for young teachers, so I found the information and coded THIS. That was the time when I was into web-developing, mostly html & css (beginner) and css-frameworks, so I choose Bootstrap for the purpose. 

I got 16/15 for the task. Two years later (now) I decided to save the project on Github (why not). You can download the archives if you want, idk

My name is real
